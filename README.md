# Full-stack Reddit Clone

### Technologies used:

###### Node.js
###### Express
###### AngularJS
###### PostgreSQL
###### KnexJS - a SQL query builder
###### Bootstrap - to help with styling

### Description

###### This Reddit Clone was my first ever Angular application. It is a full-stack CRUD application.  I made this during the third quarter of my 6 month full-stack web development immersive program and I had one week window to complete this project.

### Key Takeaways

###### I learned a lot about the Angular digest cycle and component lifecycle during this project.

###### I learned how to make a single page application and configure clean urls using HTML5 mode to allow for deep-linking.  

### App Walkthrough

### Posts View

###### From here you can view all of the posts in your feed.  You can how long ago the post was made.  You can also see how many up-votes and comments a post has received.

### Edit Post View

###### From this page you can edit the content of a post.  When you click the edit post button the form is pre-filled with the existing information from the post.  This allows you to only update the specific items that need to be updated.

### New Post Form

###### With the new post form a user can create a new post.  As you can see in this screenshot forms turn red until they are considered valid.  The create post button is also disabled until the entire form is considered valid.  Users are prompted with validation messages that inform them of the criteria they must meet to validate each field.  Once the field is valid it will turn green to notify the user that they have met the criteria for the field.

### Filter View

###### Users can also filter their feed using the Sort By button.  Users can sort the post in chronological or reverse chronological order.  They can also sort by total votes or by post title.  The posts will be dynamically sorted once a selection is made.
